## A New Way to Work, Learn, and Grow

Startery is a platform that helps people gain real experience by working on real projects—and helps startups get meaningful work done.

We’re not a school. We’re not a freelancing platform. We’re not a dev shop.

Startery is where emerging talent, startups, and contributors meet to build, learn, and create value—together.
