<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Despite cutting-edge tech, LatentAI struggled to clearly convey its value to
  non-technical stakeholders. Their branding felt fragmented, and content was
  inconsistent across sales and marketing materials.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  We helped establish a cohesive brand identity that aligned with their
  innovation edge—creating a unified voice and aesthetic that reflected
  technical credibility without overwhelming.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  Created a suite of assets: sales decks, pitch templates, explainer graphics,
  banners, and internal comms tools. All designed to improve clarity and elevate
  design across touchpoints.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  LatentAI unlocked clearer communication with enterprise buyers and investors,
  improved engagement across collateral, and maintained a more professional and
  consistent brand presence.
