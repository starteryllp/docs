<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Little Cloud Beauty lacked a cohesive brand and visual identity. Its
  product—though high quality—struggled to resonate with Western audiences or
  secure shelf space in retail environments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  We developed a soft, minimalist brand identity rooted in feminine elegance.
  Our work included logo design, brand voice guidance, color palettes, and
  digital presence recommendations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  We designed product packaging suited for Western beauty shelves. Every
  detail—from typography to tactile material suggestions—was optimized for
  elegance and market appeal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  Little Cloud Beauty now has a polished, market-ready brand and product
  presence. The updated identity has helped open conversations with retail
  buyers and align its positioning for Western expansion.
