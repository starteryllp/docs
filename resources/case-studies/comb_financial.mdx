<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Comb needed to stand out in an overcrowded DeFi landscape. They had strong
  backend tech, but no clear visual identity or go-to-market strategy—especially
  around their upcoming NFT drop.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  We crafted a striking brand system inspired by hexagonal structures in
  nature—symbolizing decentralization, strength, and order. This informed the
  name, color palette, website design, and NFT art direction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  We designed the entire user experience: from minting flow to NFT display,
  Discord integrations, and on-chain UX. Our team also built custom landing
  pages, wallet integrations, and strategy for utility-tier structuring.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  The NFT mint sold out, generating over $1.3M in volume. Comb’s Discord
  community grew by thousands, and our design system became the backbone for
  their future DeFi products.
