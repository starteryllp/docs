<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Theosis needed a design partner to define the user experience and visual
  narrative for its AI-integrated game. The early product lacked design
  direction, leaving players disoriented and key AI features underutilized.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  Startery established a modern fantasy art style across all touchpoints—clean,
  vivid interfaces that evoked mysticism and clarity. The visual system was
  designed to complement AI-powered actions and encourage exploration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  Our team designed and delivered all in-game UI elements: menus, overlays,
  battle sequences, and player onboarding flows. Every interaction was
  intentional—built to balance aesthetic delight with intuitive control.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  Theosis received investor and user praise for its polish and depth. Our work
  helped define the game’s core identity and made the AI support features more
  discoverable, intuitive, and engaging for players.
