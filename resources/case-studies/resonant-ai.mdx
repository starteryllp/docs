<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  The original product, Rebite, aimed to eliminate restaurant waste by offering
  flash sales during offpeak hours. Despite a strong launch on 3 college
  campuses and presence in the app store, it struggled to gain traction with
  users and couldn’t validate retention or willingness to pay.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Pivot">
  After structured reflection and market analysis with the Startery team, the
  founders pivoted toward a growing opportunity in AI infrastructure: a
  marketplace for specialized AI agents built for consumer and business use
  cases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand & Product">
  Startery advised on Resonant’s positioning, messaging, and go-to-market angle.
  We redesigned the brand identity, created the logo, and helped build initial
  GTM materials for both users and developers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  Resonant AI signed its first paying customer within one week of relaunch. The
  team now has early signs of product-market fit and continues to scale with a
  clear value prop, focused roadmap, and growing customer interest.
