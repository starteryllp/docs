<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Atana wanted to bring India’s richness to American travelers but had no
  structured GTM plan, brand identity, or influencer playbook to create buzz and
  conversions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  We shaped Atana’s identity from scratch—name, story, aesthetic, and tone. The
  brand evokes majesty, intimacy, and cultural immersion. We built everything:
  logo, palette, tagline, visual system, and positioning narrative.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  We designed a seamless customer experience for travelers—from landing page to
  itinerary flow. We also built the influencer marketing engine: tiered campaign
  structures, recruitment strategy, content packs, and compensation models.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  Atana soft-launched with a waitlist of interested travelers and 20+ creators
  expressing intent to collaborate. The company now has a differentiated,
  scalable brand and a repeatable go-to-market playbook.
