<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Acopia's portfolio companies lacked centralized research and consistent
  go-to-market strategy support. Teams often relied on fragmented data and
  limited internal bandwidth to make key decisions, slowing down execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  We maintained a low-profile advisory relationship, positioning Startery as an
  extension of Acopia’s internal strategy function. Our goal was to empower—not
  overshadow—the operators in the portfolio.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  Across engagements, we developed research templates, validation frameworks,
  and benchmarking tools. These resources helped portfolio companies move faster
  with clearer insight.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  Delivered market insights that directly influenced several investment
  decisions and GTM strategies. Enabled faster iteration for founders and
  de-risked early-stage bets.
