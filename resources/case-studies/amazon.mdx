## Summary

We helped Amazon transform its fulfillment centers from purely functional warehouses into inspiring environments that celebrated its mission, people, and local roots.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Problem">
  Amazon’s fulfillment centers were sterile, gray, and uninspiring—hardly
  reflective of the culture or impact the company wanted to cultivate. Workers
  had few environmental cues that reinforced Amazon’s values, and morale
  suffered in many locations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Brand">
  We worked closely with Amazon’s internal teams to create a visual system that
  aligned with their global brand while honoring the uniqueness of each
  warehouse’s local context. The branding wasn’t just decorative—it was
  narrative.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Product">
  Our team designed large-scale murals, cultural storytelling pieces, and visual
  installations tailored to each center. These pieces featured themes like
  innovation, sustainability, global reach, and local pride—while keeping
  Amazon’s customer obsession at the center.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Results">
  Fulfillment centers reported a notable increase in team sentiment and positive
  feedback. Employees felt more connected to the company’s larger mission. The
  installations are now being expanded to more centers across the U.S.
