## Scoped Work, Fast Delivery

The Bountyboard is our async delivery layer. Companies post clear requests. Operators complete them quickly and cleanly.

Great for MVP tasks, testing new features, or spinning up design and research deliverables.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Post a Bounty">
    Describe what you need. We’ll help scope it into small, clear deliverables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. We Brodcast Bounties to Relevant Operators">
    We match the best fit based on past work, skills, and alignment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Complete + Review">
    Operators complete the work async, with check-in options. You review and
    approve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Payment + Rating">
    Once approved, payment is released. You leave feedback. Everyone levels up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>Bounties typically range \$1K–\$3K and run over 1–2 weeks.</Note>
