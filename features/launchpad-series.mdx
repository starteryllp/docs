## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Kickoff + Challenge">
    Operators are assigned to small teams and given a real-world prompt to
    solve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Build Sprint">
    Over 4 weeks, teams research, design, prototype, and build—then prepare a
    final presentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Hackathon Demo Day">
    Final projects are presented live to a panel of mentors, operators, and
    venture partners.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Evaluation + Offers">
    Operators are rated and leveled. Top performers get accepted into Startery
    and may receive paid offers immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>
