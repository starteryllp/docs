## Profit Sharing (for Partners)

Partners who contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem over time earn equity-like benefits.

| Level                    | Upside                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Partner                  | Uncapped pay + revenue split + profit share    |
| Founding Partner / Elder | Governance role + legacy revenue participation |

<Note>
  Partner compensation is meritocratic and transparent. Our goal is to make
  Partner status aspirational, not political.
