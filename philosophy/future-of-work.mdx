## What Comes After the 9-to-5?

Most work ecosystems today are built on outdated models—resume filters, unpaid internships, uninspiring roles, rigid hierarchies.

Startery flips that.

We’re building a world where:

- You can get real experience by actually doing real work.
- You can earn money as a student without selling your soul.
- You can level up through merit, not connections or titles.
- You can build a reputation instead of chasing credentials.
- You can contribute meaningfully to real startups, products, and communities.
