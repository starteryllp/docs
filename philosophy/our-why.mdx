description: "Why Startery exists, what we believe in, and the north star that guides our work."

## A Different Kind of Workforce

Startery was built to answer a question:  
**What would the world look like if work made people come alive?**

We don’t believe people should have to choose between doing good work, being paid fairly, and living a fulfilled life.  
Startery is the first step toward building a new kind of economy—one that rewards aligned, intentional contribution over credentials, gatekeeping, or extraction.
