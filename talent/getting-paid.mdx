description: "How compensation works for Operators—by level, milestone, and role."
---

## Payment Structure

All Operators are paid for their work. Compensation is determined by:

- Your **Operator Level**
- The **project scope**
- Whether you're leading the project (PM, EM, or Partner)

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Join a Project">
Once you’re accepted into Startery, you’ll see available gigs that match your level. You can apply or get matched.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Agree to Scope and Rate">
  Each project has a clear deliverable and pre-negotiated rate based on your
  level and role.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Submit Milestones">
  You’ll be paid in stages—usually 50% at midpoint and 50% at final delivery.
  Your PM or EM will review quality and alignment.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Get Paid">
Payments are made via Stripe or direct deposit. You’ll receive documentation and feedback post-project.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Startery handles all payment logistics. You focus on delivering great work.
