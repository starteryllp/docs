## Become an Operator

We don’t ask for résumés or cover letters. We care about how you think, how you build, and how you work with others.

Whether you’re a student, recent grad, or experienced freelancer, Startery is a place to grow through action.

<Step title="Step 1 – Join the Launchpad">
Submit your interest and join our onboarding sprint. It’s a mix of workshops, challenges, and project-based collaboration with other applicants.

<Step title="Step 2 – Complete a Team Sprint">
You’ll join a 3–5 person team for a real-world client simulation. Together, you’ll tackle a scoped project and present your work.

<Step title="Step 3 – Get Rated and Placed">
