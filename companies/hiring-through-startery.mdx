## Try Before You Hire

One of the best things about Startery? You don’t need to commit on Day 1.

Work with Operators on real projects, see who shines, and make a full-time offer when it makes sense.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Work With an Operator">
You’ll work together on a paid project. You get to know their skills, work ethic, and communication style in real life.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Make a Hire">
  If there’s a mutual match, you can extend an offer. We support the transition.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Pay the Hiring Fee">
We charge:
- **5% of annual salary** from your side
- **5% from the Operator** (already baked into comp)

After 12 months of successful retention, we charge a bonus fee of **7.5%** each.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  This model ensures aligned incentives across the board—and gives both sides
  room to test things first.
