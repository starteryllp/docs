## The Startery Way

We combine structured Operator levels with AI-augmented staffing agents to build the right team for your needs.

Here’s how it works.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Operator Levels" icon="diagram-project">
    Every Operator is vetted and leveled (Apprentice → Partner). You get exactly
    the experience you need.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Scoping" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    We turn your request into a clear scope—defining roles, timeline, and
    deliverables.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Talent Matching" icon="person-arrow-up-from-line">
    We auto-match based on past performance, expertise, availability, and
    interest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Teaming" icon="people-arrows-left-right">
    We assemble a flexible team that evolves with your project. No overhiring,
    no under-delivering.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Need a Designer and a Developer for a 3-week sprint? Or a full team with a PM
  and Engagement Manager? We staff both types—fast.
